Well this car is automatic, systematic, hydromatic
Why it's greased lightnin'!
Grease-eee greased lightnin'!
Grease-eee greased lightnin'!
Grease-eee greased lightnin'!
Greased lightnin'!
I got chills
They're multiplyin'
And I'm losin' control
Cause the power
You're supplyin'
It's electrifyin'!

[Sandy]
You better shape up 
Cause I need a man 
And my heart is set on you 
You better shape up
You better understand 
To my heart I must be true
