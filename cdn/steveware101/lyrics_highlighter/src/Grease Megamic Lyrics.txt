[Danny]
Well this car is automatic, systematic, hydromatic
Why it's greased lightnin'!
Grease-eee greased lightnin'!
Grease-eee greased lightnin'!
Grease-eee greased lightnin'!
Greased lightnin'!
I got chills
They're multiplyin'
And I'm losin' control
Cause the power
You're supplyin'
It's electrifyin'!

[Sandy]
You better shape up 
Cause I need a man 
And my heart is set on you 
You better shape up
You better understand 
To my heart I must be true 

[Danny]
Nothin' left, nothin' left for me to do

[Both]
You're the one that I want
o ,o ,oo , honey
The one that I want
o ,o ,oo , honey
The one that I want
o ,o , ooooo
The one I need 
Oh, yes indeed

[Danny]
Why it's greased lightnin'!
(Greased lightnin'!)

[Danny/Guys]
We'll get some overhead lifters, and some four barrel quads, oh yeah
Keep talkin', whoah keep talkin'
Fuel injection cut off, and chrome plated rods, oh yeah
I'll get the money, I'll kill to get the money
With a four-speed on the floor, they'll be waitin' at the door
You know that I ain't braggin', she's a real pussy wagon-greased lightnin' 

[Chorus: Danny/Guys]
Go, greased lightnin', you're burnin' up the quarter mile 
Greased lightnin', go greased lightnin'
Go, greased lightnin', you're coastin' through the heat lap trials 
Greased lightnin', go greased lightnin'
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream for greased lightnin' 

[Danny/Guys]
We'll get some purple French tail lights and thirty-inch fins, oh yeah 
A palomino dashboard and duel muffler twins, oh yeah 
With new pistons, plugs, and shocks, I can get off my rocks
You know that I ain't braggin', she's a real pussy wagon - greased lightnin 

[Danny]
Summer lovin', had me a blast

[Sandy]
Summer lovin', happened so fast

[Danny]
I met a girl crazy for me

[Sandy]
Met a boy cute as can be

[Both]
Summer days drifting away, to uh-oh those summer nights

[All]
O well-a well-a well-a huh

[Guys/Thunderbirds]
Tell me more, tell me more

[Guys/Doody]
Did you get very far?

[Girls/Pink Ladies]
Tell me more, tell me more

[Girls/Marty]
Like does he have a car?


[Danny]
She swam by me, she got a cramp 

[Sandy]
He ran by me, got my suit damp 

[Danny]
I saved her life, she nearly drowned 

[Sandy]
He showed off, splashing around 

[Both]
Summer sun, something's begun, but uh-oh those summer nights 

[Girls/Pink Ladies]
Tell me more, tell me more

[Girls/Frenchy]
Was it love at first sight?

[Guys/Thunderbirds]
Tell me more, tell me more

[Guys/Kenickie]
Did she put up a fight?

[Sandy]
It turned colder - that's where it ends 

[Danny]
So I told her we'd still be friends 

[Sandy]
Then we made our true love vow

[Danny]
Wonder what she's doing now

[Both]
Summer dreams ripped at the seams
But, oh those summer nights (tell me more, tell me more, more)
