The "Wheel of Life" is a self-assessment exercise that provides a visual representation of your satisfaction and balance across various key areas of your life. By scoring different life categories and their sub-areas, you can identify areas that need more attention and create a plan for personal growth and development.

This is important for Two reasons

The First: 
Balance is vital for our overall well-being because we are not just isolated individuals but holistic beings, comprised of interconnected physical, emotional, spiritual, and social dimensions. Nurturing each of these aspects ensures that no single area overshadows others, preventing burnout and promoting a sense of fulfillment. 
Often, feelings of stress, unhappiness, or unfulfillment can be traced back to an imbalance in our lives. When one or more areas are neglected, it creates a ripple effect, impacting our overall sense of well-being. The Wheel of Life empowers you to identify these imbalances and take proactive steps to restore equilibrium, leading to a more fulfilling and joyful life.

The second:
Just as any journey begins with a clear understanding of our starting point, so too does the path to a fulfilling life. The Wheel of Life acts as a metaphorical map, providing a visual representation of your current life balance. By honestly assessing each area, you gain clarity on your current situation, enabling you to set meaningful goals and chart a course towards a more fulfilling and balanced life. Remember, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step — and that first step is understanding where you stand today.

This exercise will guide you through eight different pillars of life, such as Personal Finance, Relationships: Intimate and Social, and Health and Aging.

For each pillar, you'll rank several sub-areas on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being extremely satisfied and 1 being not very satisfied. Ranking these sub-areas will calculate an overall average score for that pillar.

This average score serves as a helpful reference. Ultimately, you'll decide the final score for the main pillar, also on a scale of 1 to 10, based on your overall satisfaction in that area of your life.

Rate each area based on how happy and content YOU are, not what others expect.

If you're earning $50,000 a year and feel incredibly happy and fulfilled, your score should be closer to a 10.
If you're earning $1 million a year but feel very dissatisfied, your score should be closer to a 1.
